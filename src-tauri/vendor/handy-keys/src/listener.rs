//! Keyboard listener for streaming raw key events
//!
//! This module provides a `KeyboardListener` that streams all keyboard events,
//! useful for implementing "record hotkey" UI flows.
//!
//! # Platform Notes
//!
//! - **macOS**: Uses CGEventTap. Requires accessibility permissions.
//! - **Windows**: Uses low-level keyboard hooks. Clean thread shutdown.
//! - **Linux**: Reads evdev devices directly (Wayland, X11, and console
//!   alike). Requires read access to `/dev/input` (`input` group).
//!   Blocking grabs keyboards exclusively and re-injects non-blocked
//!   events through uinput, so it additionally requires write access to
//!   `/dev/uinput`. Clean thread shutdown.
