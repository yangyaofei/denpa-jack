//! Linux keyboard listener reading evdev devices directly
//!
//! A single thread polls every keyboard-capable `/dev/input/event*` device
//! plus an inotify watch on `/dev/input` for hotplug. Reading evdev
//! directly needs no X11 or Wayland connection, so the listener works
//! identically on both and on a bare console; it requires read access to
//! the device nodes (typically membership in the `input` group).
//!
//! # Blocking
//!
//! Without blocking, devices are opened non-exclusively — nothing is
//! grabbed, nothing is injected. With blocking enabled, every *keyboard*
//! is grabbed exclusively (EVIOCGRAB) and its events re-injected through a
//! per-device uinput clone, minus the key events that match a blocking
//! hotkey. Pointer devices are never grabbed (their buttons are observed
//! read-only, so mouse-button hotkeys are detected but not blocked —
//! matching the Windows backend). Blocking therefore additionally needs
//! write access to `/dev/uinput`, verified at spawn.
//!
//! Each listener tracks the device nodes of its own uinput clones and
//! filters exactly those from its enumeration (reading one's own output
//! would loop). Other listeners — including in other processes — read the
//! clones like ordinary keyboards, so a listener stacked behind a blocking
//! one still sees every non-blocked event. Blocking listeners, however,
//! never *grab* each other's clones (recognized by name prefix): two
//! blockers cloning each other's clones would mint new uinput devices
//! without bound. First blocker wins; later ones detect but cannot block
//! what it already grabbed.
//!
//! # Modifier-state recovery
//!
//! Tracked modifiers are seeded from the kernel's key state (EVIOCGKEY) at
//! startup and re-reconciled against it whenever the kernel reports a
//! dropped-buffer overflow (`SYN_DROPPED`) or a device disappears while
//! keys are held. Stale modifiers are cleared with synthetic release
//! events, sharing `release_events` with the Windows listener.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! Dropping the listener flips the shared `running` flag; the poll loop
//! wakes at least every `POLL_TIMEOUT_MS`, observes it, and exits. Closing
//! the device fds releases every grab, and dropping the uinput clones
//! destroys them.
